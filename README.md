# Tekdoom
A multiplayer Doom-like in C

Works with the LiLapin (Epitech's graphic lib, based on SFML)

We had to code a Doom-Like game.

Bonus :   

          - Our own 3D engine
          - Multiplayer
              - In-game chat (TPC thread)
              - Up to 8 players (UDP thread)
              - Ready for procedural generation of map (sending / receiving seed)
          - HUD with animations
          - Menus (glitch animation, text input)

Because of a huge lack of time, the project isn't 100% finished / working, but stay tuned for the v2 !

Realized with Luka Boulagnon, Ludovic Petrenko and Lucas Troncy.
